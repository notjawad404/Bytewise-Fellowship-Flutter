In this week I have created a calculator app while mainly utilizing following widgets:

# 1. MaterialApp: This is the root widget of the app that sets up the basic structure for the app and provides various configuration options.

# 2. Scaffold: This widget provides a basic visual structure for the app, including an app bar and a body.

# 3. AppBar: This widget represents the top app bar that contains the title of the app.

# 4. Column: This widget arranges its children in a vertical column.

# 5. Container: This widget is a generic container that can be used to group and layout other widgets.

# 6. Text: This widget displays text on the screen.

# 7. Divider: This widget draws a horizontal line to separate sections of the app.

# 8. Row: This widget arranges its children in a horizontal row.

# 9. Table: This widget provides a way to arrange its children in a grid.

# 10. MaterialButton: This widget represents a button that can be pressed by the user.

# 11. Expanded: This widget takes up all the available space in a row or column.
